I store all my data in this directory. 
The subdirectory called raw_data contains raw data files and only raw data files. These files should be treated as read only and should not be changed in any way. If you need to process/clean/modify your data do this in R (not MS Excel) as you can document (and justify) any changes made. 
Any processed data should be saved to a separate file and stored in the processed_data subdirectory. 
Information about data collection methods, details of data download and any other useful metadata should be saved in a text document (see README text files below) in the metadata subdirectory.

 I often include a README file in the directory where I keep my raw data. In this file I include details about when data were collected (or downloaded), how data were collected, information about specialised equipment, preservation methods, type and version of any machines used (i.e. sequencing equipment) etc.
